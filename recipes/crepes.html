    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crepes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour: These basic French crepes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
      <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.</li>
      <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and keeps the crepes tender.</li>
      <li>Water: Water helps thin the batter.</li>
      <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.</li>
      <li>Butter: Butter lends richness and moisture to the crepes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk the milk, water, eggs, and salt.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the flour and butter.</li>
      <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle.</li>
      <li>Cook until lightly browned on the bottom.</li>
      <li>Flip and continue cooking until done on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
